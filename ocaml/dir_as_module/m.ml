1. with `true: include` in _tags, both x/a.ml and y/a.ml are included, and only y/a.ml will be used
2. without it, it doesn't find A
3. so it seems like there is no way around having prefixed filenames, e.g. x/xa.ml and then a file x.ml with aliases Ã  la `module A = Xa`?
4. adding {x,y}.mlpack works! but only m.byte, for native, we also need to add for-pack to _tags

Also interesting: note the order of outputs! No X outputs if it isn't accessed.
